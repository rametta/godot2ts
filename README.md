# ü§ñ Godot to TypeScript

This CLI tool generates TypeScript types and helpers based on Godot's GDScript files.

> *Usage instructions coming soon...*

:::warning

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This tool marks TypeScript as a peer-dependency and requires it to be available in `node_modules` at runtime. 

This is to keep the binary smaller and flexible with whichever version of Typescript used in your project.
